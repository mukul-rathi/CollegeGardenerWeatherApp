So, when creating a new scene, you need:

A fxml file. This should contain all of your objects that you want it to have and the visual layout that you want

For anything that needs some kind of interaction, you need an fx:id for it, which is an fxml attribute named fx:id.
You also need to specify a controller class.

Then, when you have done this, you need to create said controller class in you java code.
Then create all of the objects you need, importing the relevant fx classes.
Each fxml object should have the label @FXML above it and it name should be exactly its fx:id

Then after you have done this, for any action methods you have, create them as private/public void methods.
(you can create labels for these actions in scene builder - such as handleBackButton for example).

Then - to switch scenes. You need to pass the scene you want to switch to into the controller class of the scene you
want to make. This involves a new fxml loader. See the Ben_frontend code in my setupSwitches method.

Then in your event handler, see the example in the settings controller class, get the current stage from your
fxml object that has just been clicked on and set that stage to have the scene that you just passed in. Noice.
